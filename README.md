# Interactive-multimedia-


For this the project, the interactive multimedia, I had created a program composed of 2 scenes.To run the program, you would simply need to open up an ide like vs code and run the html connected to the javascript file. To navigate between the 2 scenes, you would need to make a sound like clapping or talking very loud. Once this sound is recognized by the program, it will flip to the other screen. The first scene is the main part of the program and that is an old fashioned snake game. It has a basic score tracker and ends when there is a collision against the walls. The second scene, is a ball bouncing around the wall similar to when a tv is idle.


some features:
1. sound input when eating apple and to switch between scenes
2. keyboard imput for controlling the snake
3. score tracker
4. collision sensor
   

Steps to run:

1. download the html and js and open them on an Ide.
2. run the html.
